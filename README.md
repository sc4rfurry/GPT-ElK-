```text
    python3 -m pip install venv
    python3 -m venv env
    source env/bin/activate
```

##
> For this tool to run you have to [Signup](https://beta.openai.com/signup) and get your OpenAI Api Key that should be like following `sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`.

- Create a new file named `.env` and save your OpenAI api key in that file as following:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY='sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx'
```
#
### Usage

```bash
python3 main.py -m [text/code]
```
##

### Options

```bash
        -m              Mode to use.    [text/code]
        -h              Help Menu
```
> `-m` mode have two options, one is `text` that uses OpenAI Generic Engine like `text-davinci-003` for generic queries and the other option is `code` is to get the explaination of any code provided in a file because this option usesOpenAI Engine like `code-davinci-002` for code completion or analysis.   

##

### Example
```bash
1) python3 main.py -m text
2) python3 main.py -m code
```
> **Note**: The `code` mode is for code explaination using ChatGPT. It gets the code file and tries to explian the code using OpenAI GPT-3 but it is limited and have a rate limit and results could depends on your api (Trial/Paid) and could give you error if the result is more than **3000** limit.
